=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

(none)

=== Version/Release 2.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2019.09.04; Maikuolan]: Added *partial* internal language support for
  Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish. Will sync it all up with the other
  translations when there's time.

- [2019.09.06; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found a way to trigger an invalid argument
  warning at the front-end updates page in some contexts; Fixed.

- [2019.09.17; Maikuolan]: Added an events orchestrator and refactored.

- [2019.09.18; Maikuolan]: Added an error handler event to be able to catch and
  report errors more effectively.

- [2019.09.24; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Improved error logging and added a
  default error log handler to take care of error logging in the absence of any
  custom event handlers for error logging. A new configuration directive has
  been added accordingly (error_log). Additionally, all event handlers have
  been moved into their own file, to keep them separated from function/closure
  definitions and to improve maintainability. Some minor refactoring has also
  occurred affecting the aforementioned and calls made to the time formatter.

- [2019.09.26; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some pre-condition checks weren't being
  processed correctly, causing OLE objects to not be recognised correctly in
  some cases (thanks to Costegillio for bringing this to my attention); Fixed.

- [2019.09.26; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some of the missing directory guards were
  faulty (thanks to Costegillio for bringing this to my attention); Fixed.
  Refer github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/210

- [2019.09.29; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to automatically
  repair some components via the front-end updates page.

- [2019.10.02; Maikuolan]: Added a new vendor shorthand entry (abuse.ch).

=== Version/Release 2.0.0 ===
MAJOR RELEASE (BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE).

- [2019.05.31; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to automatically
  switch between different channels when requesting a remote resource (e.g.,
  when the front-end updates page attempts to update something, or attempts to
  retrieve the latest available component metadata), for whenever such a
  request fails (e.g., due to server errors, the requested resource no longer
  existing at a particular location, etc), and added a new configuration
  directive, "disabled_channels", to optionally prevent phpMussel from ever
  requesting resources from particular, specific channels.

- [2019.06.17; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to optionally update only all
  signature files to the front-end updates page (as opposed to updating
  everything at once).

- [2019.06.27; Maikuolan]: Shifted responsibility for number formatting out
  from the front-end functions file, into its own, distinct class.

- [2019.07.10; Maikuolan]: The front-end updates page now sets "verify" as the
  default option for components, to help reduce the risk that users select
  "uninstall" or "deactivate" by accident.

- [2019.07.10; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved front-end pie chart colouring.

- [2019.07.26; Maikuolan]: Added condition to ensure that "delete" should never
  be the default option selected for files shown at the front-end file manager.

- [2019.08.05-06; MAJOR CODE CHANGE; Maikuolan]: Removed PHP 5.4 polyfills,
  thereby immediately upping the minimum PHP version requirement for the
  upcoming release. Updated the loader, upping the hardcoded minimum PHP
  version requirement to PHP 7.2, and removed some no longer needed code.
  Removed some extraneous .htaccess files (only really need our main .htaccess
  file in the base of the vault nowadays; the extra .htaccess files in some of
  the vault's subdirectories aren't necessary). Renamed a number of
  configuration directives in order to better comply with the phpMussel code
  style guidelines regarding the use of snake_case for configuration
  directives. Shifted the class autoloader out from the functions file, into
  the main loader. Added PHP7-style type hinting and return type declarations
  wherever applicable. Updated all common classes package classes to the latest
  compatible versions. Added some missing PHPDoc comments.

- [2019.08.17; Maikuolan]: Reinstated the "lang_override" directive.

- [2019.08.23; Maikuolan]: Slightly refactored the front-end updates page,
  related closures and other related functionality, and added the ability to
  install/activate or to deactivate/uninstall with a single action (previously,
  these actions had to be done separately, as two actions). Added some new
  switches/filters.

- [2019.08.24; Maikuolan]: Added last modified date/time to the file listings
  at the front-end file manager and fixed a possible issue with correct icon
  display for some not yet used file formats.

- [2019.08.31; Maikuolan]: Removed some unnecessary code from the loader, left
  over from some old features already removed a long time ago.
