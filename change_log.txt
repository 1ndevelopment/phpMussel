phpMussel change_log.txt

=== Version 0.3a ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18088+3A).
Fixed one small yet significant bug in the update script.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found there was an incorrectly written condition operand which would cause
  the update script to always register CRC32 hashes as being mismatched,
  even if they were a correct match. Fixed it. Literally is one byte of
  difference, but unfortunately, will be required to manually update to the
  latest version before using the update script, because the old version won't
  work. Tested the update locally and it seems to work fine now.

=== Version 0.3 ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+17971+3).
Huge number of significant changes !! Refer below.

NEW CHANGES:
- Built a (very basic) command interface and an updater !!
  Implemented a POST, GET and QUERY based command system, whereby certain
  functions can be performed by triggering them via either POST, GET or QUERY,
  meaning.. you can do things to phpMussel from within your browser.
- phpMussel can now be updated automatically via password protected command.
- phpMussel can be enabled and disabled via password protected command.
- Logs can be viewed from your browser via password protected command.
- Refined the main script and heavily expanded on non ClamAV sigantures.
- Added signature greylisting capabilities.
- Added some basic fraudulent metadata detections.

=== Version 0.2b ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest ClamAV signatures (55+17946).
Release not stable; Will roll to next version (0.3).

8th October 2013.

=== Version 0.2a ===
SUMMARY:
Sub-minor update.

NEW CHANGES:
- Did a bit of research; Added a bunch of signatures to the custom signatures.
  These are all signatures that I strongly feel should be included with
  phpMussel, but, because they are neither related to the testfiles nor a part
  of signature set obtained from ClamAV, I've opted to place them in customs.
  Of course, if anyone disagrees, they are more than welcome to remove them.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Fixed a small problem found concerning occasionally mismatched file
  extensions that were causing some strange false-positives in testing (mostly
  concerning zip files and c files).

=== Version 0.2 ===
SUMMARY:
My many thanks to those that helped with testing out the initial (and
subsequent) release of phpMussel. :-)
After receiving some great suggestions and ideas from Tobias (Spambotsecurity)
regarding the previous release of phpMussel, I went to work changing a lot
of what had been coded into the previous releases, combining most of those
suggestions with a couple of new tricks I'd learned over the course of the
past few days. These changes overall should drastically improve the
performance, speed and effectiveness of phpMussel, as well as correct some
theoretical exploits discovered. I've also began working on implementing
more of the ClamAV signatures than the previous version could support, and
while this version is by no means complete, it should be a drastic improvement
over the previous version. It should be noted that modifications have been
made to the vault files and signature files against, thus, this version of the
script will not be compatible with previous versions of the script.

NEW CHANGES:
- Added support for GZIP'd files (can now read and interpret the contents
  of GZIP'd files, parse GZIP metadata, and, can do so recursively; new
  configuration option added to control maximum recursion depth)! With that,
  phpMussel now supports GZ and ZIP encoded archives. Though, ZIPs still
  aren't recursive and other common formats (7z, RAR) aren't yet supported.
- Removed several custom-built functions altogether, replacing with faster
  php-native equivalents, with new custom-built functions implemented to mimic
  these functions when not available for purposes of backwards-compatibility.
- Improved compatibility with external error handlers.
- Multi-instance checking implemented.
- Generally improved coding to reduce risk of warning flags (New/Fixed?).
- Extended signatures have been (mostly) implemented (although, split into
  segments for improved performance and usability). At this point, even
  after a bit of research, I've still got absolutely no idea how to correctly
  implement PE Sectional signatures, so, I suspect that one may take a long
  time to get done. However, otherwise, most signatures should now be
  implemented correctly. Normalised signatures (HTML, ASCII, etc) coming soon.
- Began implementation of proper block notifications. Intend to expand this
  at a later date.
- New testfile set (replacing old testfile set).
- Added an email scanning function (will need to implement this yourself as
  per your specific requirements).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- While the time requirements for checking against ClamAV signatures still
  leaves something to be desired, the time requirements have been more than
  halved in most testing instances. Although not ideal, I think this has
  been improved enough to warrant making note of it here.
- phpMussel now supports wildcards (thus increasing the number of ClamAV
  signatures that can be correctly checked against)!
- Several bugs found since the previous release fixed prior to this one (can
  directly compare code between versions if necessary; mostly sub-minor bugs).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FOUND:
- As a side-effect of changes to this version, although time requirements
  for signatures has been generally reduced, this reduction is scaled by both
  the quantity and size of the files being scanned. Additionally, the memory
  requirements of the script per each file being scanned, at present, is about
  ~2.7xFilesize (example: if we assumed approximately ~2MB was required for the
  script itself, assumed that all loaded signatures for that instance required
  about ~6.7MB and assumed that the file targeted for scanning had a filesize
  of about ~24.4MB, the total memory required by the process would be somewhere
  in the range of ~74.6MBs). On php5, where the default memory limit is set
  at 128MBs, this isn't a problem. However, for php4, where the default memory
  limit is 64MBs, or for older versions of php where the default memory limit
  is even less, this would cause maximum memory exceeded fatal warning to be
  supplied by php and cause the entire script (including whatever is hooking
  the script) to die prematurely. For the time being, a solution for older
  systems is to simply set a lower filesize threshold in the phpMussel
  configuration file. However, in the long term, another, better, solution
  should be found.

NEW GOALS AND FUTURE VERSIONING GUIDELINES:
To qualify for the next major version release (Version 1.0):
- Improve time requirements for all ClamAV signatures, as to negate any risk
  of providing a vector for potential DDoS attacks.
- Have implemented ALL signature types, correctly, functioning correctly
  during a live test, without any time requirement problems.
- Be capable of scanning archive formats, at minimum, ZIP, GZ, RAR, 7z.
- Be capable of scanning ALL supported archive formats RECURSIVELY.
- (Optionally) produce new goals for a follow-up version (major/minor).
- Fix known bugs.
To qualify for a minor version release (Version 0.X):
- Any -significant- changes to the script, at all, including completing one or
  more of the above goals and including bringing in any new features or
  capabilities, whereby having been done, the script does not qualify for a
  new major version release.
To quality for a sub-minor version release (0.Xy, 0.X.Y, 0.Xy.Z, 0.X.Yz):
- Any other changes to the script.

=== Version 0.1a ===
SUMMARY:
Sub-minor update.

NEW CHANGES:
- Added some additional file manipulation detections and slightly changed
  some of the configuration defaults.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Corrected a small handful of typographical errors (d'oh!) that I'd found
  hiding in the documentation and various comments throughout the package (didn't
  spot any in the script itself, at least).
- Found and fixed the bug relating to chameleon attack detection (updating
  from previous script version recommended to avoid possible false-positive
  matches, due to the nature of the bug).

=== Version 0.1 ===
SUMMARY:
The initial release, built from the ground-upwards, no previous version:
Goals of the initial release are to create something that, albeit requiring
much future work and perhaps with a benefit extremely minimal compared to its
intended future goals, does actually work correctly to a level satisfying what
would be expected of an initial release of the script as per the expectations of
the script, without, from its default configuration and assuming no
programmatic deviations, posing any inherent problems for any to implement the
script and for and desirable end-users. The expectations of the script,
in-line with the goals of the project overall, can be adequately surmised by
the description of the script as included, at the time of this release, in the
main body of the script itself: "Thank you for using phpMussel, a php-based
script based upon ClamAV signatures designed to detect Trojans, viruses,
malware and etcetera within files uploaded to your system wherever the script
is hooked."

NEW CHANGES (PRIMARY ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS VERSION):
- Can successfully detect file uploads and scan those files and the contents of
  those files.
- Can successfully interpret the MD5 signatures of ClamAV and check against
  those signatures when scanning files.
- Can successfully interpret custom MD5 signatures and check against those
  signatures when scanning files.
- Can successfully interpret the basic signatures of ClamAV and check against
  those signatures when scanning files.
- Can successfully interpret custom basic signatures and check against those
  signatures when scanning files.
- Can successfully detect archives (ZIP files only at this point) and
  individually scan the files contained in those archives.
- Can successfully interpret the ZIP MetaData signatures of ClamAV and check
  against those signatures when scanning files.
- Can successfully interpret custom ZIP MetaData signatures and check against
  those signatures when scanning files.
- Functions of the script can be controlled via a configuration file.
- Can block file uploads and automatically delete those attempted file uploads,
  as per script configuration.
- Can detect certain types of chameleon attacks successfully.
- Can log scanning operations and scan kills.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FOUND (NEW KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THIS VERSION):
- Although the basic signatures of ClamAV can be interpreted and checked
  against during file uploads, this TAKES A VERY LONG TIME! The time required
  is unacceptable (up to a minute long per file at the worst point of my
  initial testing), because it could potential create a vector for a theoretical
  attacker to successfully implement a DDoS attack against whatever phpMussel
  is hooked to. The feature remains fully implemented and functional in this
  version, but with default configuration, is disabled. Those implementing the
  script can optionally enable it if they wish, though I recommend against it
  at this point. Thankfully, the same problem does not extend to the MD5
  signatures and similar, which during initial tests, proved extremely fast
  and efficient. I have no intentions of even BEGINNING to find ways to
  implement other signatures types until this problem is resolved. In any case,
  aside from the time requirements, there doesn't appear to be any other
  problems with the basic signatures.
- High-nibble, low-nibble and general wildcard indicators are not currently
  recognised by the script. This should be fixed (preferably without
  exacerbating the time requirements problem).
- Extended signatures, PE signatures, bytecode signatures and the ClamAV
  whitelist is not yet implemented (at all).
- Archive scanning is currently limited to ZIP files. At this point, support
  for other types of archives (RAR, CAB, 7z, GZ, TAR and etcetera) is not
  supported, and the filetypes are not recognised differently from non-archive
  files.
- Archive scanning is not recursive (meaning only first-level files of archives
  will be scanned). This needs to be corrected.
- Chameleon attack detection for JPG, JPEG and PNG isn't working correctly.
  Should remain disabled until fixed.

NEW GOALS AND FUTURE VERSIONING GUIDELINES:
To qualify for the next major version release (Version 1.0):
- Correct the time requirement problem of the basic signatures, as so that it
  no longer provides a vector for DDoS attacks.
- Make the script recognise wildcards.
- Have implemented ALL signature types (MD5, Basic, Extended, Metadata, the
  whitelist [not absolutely certain about that one, so optional], Bytecode
  [if I or anyone else can work out exactly how to], as well as any other
  signatures types that may exist by the time the script has been updated),
  correctly, functioning correctly during a live test, without any time
  requirement problems.
- Be capable of scanning archives RECURSIVELY.
- (Optionally) produce new goals for a follow-up version (major/minor).
To qualify for a minor version release (Version 0.X):
- Any -significant- changes to the script, at all, including completing one or
  more of the above goals and including bringing in any new features or
  capabilities, whereby having been done, the script does not qualify for a
  new major version release.
To quality for a sub-minor version release (0.Xy, 0.X.Y, 0.Xy.Z, 0.X.Yz):
- Any other changes to the script.
