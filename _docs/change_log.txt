== CURRENT GOALS AND FUTURE VERSIONING GUIDELINES (Latest: v0.4b) ==
Next major release (v1.0):
- All planned signature implementations completed, functioning correctly during
  a live test, without any known notable problems.
  Implemented [added/last edited+]:
   * ELF signatures (stuff for Linux) [v0.2/v0.3g+];
   * PE signatures (Portable executables; EXEs, DLLs, etc) [v0.2/v0.3g+];
   * PE Sectional signatures (Sections from portable executables) [v0.4+];
   * Filename signatures [v0.3/v0.3g+];
   * General (basic) signatures [v0.1/v0.3g+];
   * General (extended) signatures [v0.1/v0.3g+];
   * Graphics signatures [v0.2/v0.3g+];
   * Mach-O signatures (stuff for Mac and Apple) [v0.2/v0.3g+];
   * Email signatures [v0.2/v0.3g+];
   * MD5 signatures [v0.1/0.3g+];
   * Archive metadata signatures [v0.1/v0.4b+];
  Partially implemented [added/last edited+]:
   * ASCII (normalised) signatures (BATs, VBs, etc) [v0.4b+];
  Not implemented (those that I hope to get these done at some point);
   * OLE2 signatures (VBA and DOCX embeds, etc);
   * HTML (normalised) signatures (HTML, JS, etc);
  Not implemented (those that I'm not yet sure if I'll do or not);
   * Icon signatures (hidden and imposter PEs, etc);
   * PE metadata signatures;
   * Container metadata signatures;
   * Logical signatures (conditional multi-extended signatures);
   * Android signatures;
- All pending to-do items completed.
   Pending Items:
   * Currently, ZIP and GZ archive formats are supported for the archive
     metadata signatures. At minimum, this should also extend to RAR and 7z.
   * Currently, GZ archive scanning is recursive. Ideally, scanning for all
     supported archive formats should be recursive.
- All known bugs fixed (none pending at this time).
Next and/or subsequent minor releases (v0.X):
- Any -significant- changes to the script including completing of any of the
  aforementioned above, whereby having done so, the release doesn't qualify as
  a major release.
Next and/or subsequent sub-minor releases (v0.Xy):
- Any other changes to the core code with latest signatures included.
Next and/or subsequent below sub-minor releases and/or re-releases (v0.Xy.Z):
- Any releases containing no changes to the core code (such as, releases
  containing only either documentation or signature updates), or any releases
  containing changes to the core code without any included signature updates.

=== Version 0.4b (Previous: 0.4a) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19279+4b).
Minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Many thanks to BlueEyed Zebra, who has successfully translated to German the
  entirety of the phpMussel documentation and the phpMussel internal language
  data, with which, phpMussel is now fully supported in the German language.
  With the addition of German, phpMussel now -fully- supports five languages
  (English, French, Indonesian, Italian, German) and -partially- supports an
  additional three (Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch; All three, internal language
  data has been fully translated but translation of the documentation is very
  incomplete). 5th August 2014.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=2929
- I've -began- working on support for the normalised ASCII signatures, and what
  I've coded thus far is working correctly, though I wouldn't call it anywhere
  near complete yet. Currently, the normalisation method that I've written
  isn't entirely identical to that which is employed by ClamAV (and thus that
  which the normalised ASCII signatures of ClamAV are written in mind with),
  and ideally, at the least, what I write should eventually either mimic or
  improve on that which is employed by ClamAV. That said, I haven't been
  working on this part of phpMussel for a particularly long time yet and it's
  certain to improve with time, and as is, still does a reasonable job. Not
  all of the relevant signatures match in the same way between ClamAV and
  phpMussel yet, but those that do (and thus, which should correctly match
  during scans by phpMussel without false-positives) have been included
  with this release (which works out to roughly ~150 signatures of the total
  ~3K±1K or so normalised ASCII signatures available from ClamAV).
  Part of the reason that I'm including it with this release, as opposed to
  waiting until I've got it 100% implemented in the way that I'm aiming for,
  is that there are some critical common CMS vulnerabilities that can be
  protected against by inclusion of a number of signatures that, at the least,
  require the level of implementation that I've currently achieved, but which
  I don't think I should hold back on for some unknown future date, thus,
  releasing where it's currently at. In any case, it shouldn't cause problems.
- Minor non-significant code optimisations of the Core Script (phpmussel.inc).
  No changes to the Language Data (lang.inc) or Update Script (update.inc)
  exist between this and the previous version.

=== Version 0.4a (Previous: 0.4; Next: 0.4b) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19260+4a).
Minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- General commands CSV tweaked slightly (hex_general_commands.csv).
- As usual, improved signature set.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Missing break statement from end of looped section in update script would
  cause forced update via CLI to infinitely loop (update.inc); Fixed.
- Corrected some minor spelling errors in the language file (lang.inc).

=== Version 0.4 (Previous: 0.3g.1; Next: 0.4a) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19164+4).
Minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- All script files and constituent content heavily modified between this
  and the previous version (language data, updater script, code script).
- Slightly improved detection method for graphics files and associated
  signatures; Support for a few additional graphics formats added.
- Slightly improved detection method for PE files and associated signatures.
- Slightly improved chameleon attack detection; Support for a few additional
  formats added.
- A few additional directives added to the phpMussel configuration.
- corrupted_exe: Option to detect and block potentially corrupted PE files.
- Success! A lot of reading up on format specifications and a lot of messing
  around trying different things with php later, I've managed to implement
  support for PE Sectional MD5 signatures! As of this version (v0.4), phpMussel
  can now check individual sections of PE files against the ClamAV PE Sectional
  MD5 signatures. :-)
  The code itself works like a charm, but unfortunately, due to the sheer size
  of the PE Sectional signatures of the ClamAV database, isn't yet entirely
  problem free. To explain the problem.. The physical size of the previous
  latest version of phpMussel (v0.3g.1), compressed, is 4.26 MBs, and
  uncompressed, is 13.2 MBs. The current physical size of the entirety of the
  mainlined PE Sectional signatures, by themselves, not including anything else
  at all, uncompressed, is.. 131.52 MBs. Daily and mains PE Sectional
  signatures combined, and processed for use with phpMusel, uncompressed, is...
  217.9 MBs. The sum of those two figures (13.2 MBs + 217.9 MBs) is 231.1 MBs,
  which is about 17-fold (or 1,700%) greater than the first figure by itself.
  A rather unpalatable increase, in my mind, and a problem that I'm not yet
  entirely sure how to deal with in the long term. For now, as a temporary
  (acceptable, but not absolutely perfect) solution (and because I wanted to
  get this release out without too much delay and needed some sort of solution
  prior to doing so), the PE Sectional signatures of ClamAV included with this
  release cover the 300,000 PE Sectional signatures most recently released by
  ClamAV, which is a rather significant number, but still far short of the
  total 3,344,332 PE Sectional signatures that exist in the current mains+daily
  release of the ClamAV database. Because of this reduction, the total filesize
  of the pe_clamav.cvd should be significantly smaller (20.5 MBs) than it'd
  otherwise be, and although not being comprehensive, at least, will run
  correctly, not crash php due to excessive memory usage and will provide a
  notable degree of protection against at least the latest known PE Sectional
  infection vectors. For more details, or, if you have any ideas to offer...
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=2870
- Added additional functionality to the CLI mode of phpMussel: Previously, it
  was only possible to update phpMussel either manually or via browser-based
  commands; It is now possible to update phpMussel via CLI mode; It is also now
  possible to generate signatures via CLI mode, in a similar fashion to how it
  is possible to generate signatures for ClamAV via their sigtool utility, and
  it is now possible to display and modify the greylist via CLI mode. Refer to
  the documentation for more details.
- Loader slightly modified (updating recommended).
- Included documentation updated to reflect the changes of this version.
- Updated existing testfiles and added one new testfile.
- As usual, improved signature set.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Greylist clear command bugged; Didn't work (hastily coded first time; made
  some silly mistakes that were easy to fix, but didn't spot them until the
  latest round of testing); Fixed.
- Incorrect suggested update date displayed upon update abort; Fixed.

=== Version 0.3g.1 (Previous: 0.3g; Next: 0.4) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19131+3g.1).
Files modified, but no changes to the actual script or code (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Updated -all- documentation - phpMussel is now -fully- supported (I define
  a language as being "fully supported" by phpMussel when translations for
  that language have been completed in the language file, "lang.inc", and when
  there is a complete, thorough translation of the README documentation in that
  language available) in four languages: English, French, Indonesian, Italian;
  Partially supported by an additional four languages (German, Spanish,
  Portuguese, Dutch), which should come to be fully supported as time passes,
  with additional languages to eventually come where time, energy, capacity,
  need and interest from the userbase permits it to be so.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found some incorrect peripheral information in the documentation; Corrected.
- Corrected some minor spelling errors in the language file (lang.inc).
- Removed some problematic false-positives from the signature set, most
  notably, "phpMussel-FN.Illegal.Character-3F", which was originally introduced
  with the previously most recent release (v0.3g), potentially falsing where
  due to a discrepancy between the actual default character encoding
  ("charset") of the upload as per assigned by the sending browser and the
  actual charset of the system where PHP is installed, the filename would be
  mangled, with question marks rendered in place of unrecognised characters.

=== Version 0.3g (Previous: 0.3f.2; Next: 0.3g.1) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19079+3g).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- phpMussel now displayed as process title when in CLI mode (PHP 5 >= 5.5.0).
- Big changes across the language file, the core script and the update script.
- As usual, improved signature set (a few potential false-positives removed,
  better protection against filename manipulation, new set of MD5s, new round
  of phishes, a number of others; also see changes noted under BUGS); Slightly
  improved signature mapping algorithm.
- Rewrote code for data normalisation and rewrote how encoding+decoding is
  handled by phpMussel (should now be a bit more thorough and bit more
  consistent throughout the different parts of the script).
- As compensation for my no longer including signatures with zero-or-more
  quantifiers in the default signature set (the zero-or-more quantifier -is-
  still supported by phpMussel, so, you can still use it, if you want, although
  I don't recommend it unless absolutely necessary in-lieu of the PCRE bug),
  I've introduced support for an equivalent into the code for handling the
  standard, non-regex based signatures. Now, if you include an ">" within a
  standard, non-regex signature, phpMussel will first match against everything
  before the immediate ">", and then, if a match is found, skip ahead in the
  data being checked to the point where the match was found and reinterpret
  the signature from the point after the immediate ">" (thus, repeat);
  Functionally equivalent to a zero-or-more match (in most, but not all, cases)
  but without the inherent problem of potentially backticking into oblivion.
- phpMussel now includes CRC32 checksums for the names and contents of scanned
  files (regardless of whether anything was detected or not) in the scan_log
  file. This could be useful for tracking down files that may be difficult to
  locate after having been uploaded (such as, for example, when trying to
  locate files containing something undesirable that may have been missed by
  phpMussel when scanned).
- A few default directives in the phpMussel configuration altered slightly
  to reflect recent changes made to the core script. Nothing significant.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Not really a -bug-, per se, but, found a few areas in the core script where
  there was some level of duplication and redundancy. Fixed.
- Took me a while, but I finally managed to get to the bottom of the PCRE bug
  (the one that I'd mentioned earlier in the change_log whereby certain
  signatures would occasionally cause PHP to crash), work out exactly what was
  triggering it and find a proper work-around for it. This release and all
  future releases, assuming I've done it correctly, should no longer contain
  ".risky" files, as the risk of PHP crashing in this particular manner should
  no longer be a problem for these future releases. The trigger was phpMussel
  trying to match signatures containing zero-or-more quantifiers (*) against
  non-matching files above certain system dependent filesize values leading to
  rampant runaway backticking. In short, via a lot of testing and debugging..
  Although I already knew it was -possible- to do this, I never realised quite
  just how easy it was before, but, I've discovered just how easy it is, in
  fact, when dealing with PCRE functions, to cause PCRE to make PHP backtick
  itself into oblivion by way of throwing sufficiently large non-matching data
  at those functions. As a result of this, 12 (of the some 40,000+) of the
  currently active signatures in use by phpMussel as per supplied by ClamAV
  have been redacted, and 245 signatures have been modified, replacing the
  zero-or-more quantifiers (*) with specific numeric quantifiers ({n,n}),
  and changes have been made to the core script in an attempt to prevent the
  situation from arising again.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=58&t=2794
- There was a minor bug in CLI mode whereby specifying directories to scan
  without including a trailing slash in the directory path would result in
  phpMussel stating that the directory didn't exist, regardless of whether it
  actually existed or not. Fixed; Directories are now interpret the same,
  regardless of whether there is an included trailing slash or not.

=== Version 0.3f.2 (Previous: 0.3f.1; Next: 0.3g) ===
SUMMARY:
Hot-fix (low priority).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found a bug whereby in the event of certain signature collisions occurring,
  it is theoretically possible that certain detections could be missed,
  although in practise, no such collisions currently exist. Fixed.

Maikuolan,
27th May 2014.

=== Version 0.3f.1 (Previous: 0.3f; Next: 0.3f.2) ===
SUMMARY:
Hot-fix (low priority).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found a small typo in the update functionality that could theoretically
  prevent some certain files from updating correctly in some certain
  situations. Fixed.

Maikuolan,
24th May 2014.

=== Version 0.3f (Previous: 0.3e; Next: 0.3f.1) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19012+3f).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Added better error detection for file uploads.
- Continued work and improvement on multilingual support; Core script/program
  now supports eight languages (available languages listed in configuration);
  No new language support for documentation since previous version. Take in
  mind that, because my native language is English and I am not fluent with any
  other languages, there'll probably be the odd error here and there. I make no
  apologies for this, but endevour to fix them whenever they become apparent.
- Un-did some of the *_standard.cvd to *_regex.cvd swaps from the previous
  update for improved performance, manually removing any falsables I could
  find.
- Improved the default Upload Denied message template file slightly.
- Minor code tweaks for improved performance.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- A compatibility issue between phpMussel and several CMS and forum systems
  that handle $_FILES in unexpected ways having been brought to my attention,
  I've added a new compatibility section to the phpMussel configuration. As it
  stands at this time, that section only has one directive, which concerns the
  specific issue brought to attention, but will probably grow as time goes by.
  The issue brought to attention was that these CMS and forum systems would
  behave in ways that resulted in $_FILES array elements being parsed to
  phpMussel with the elements of these array elements, which should normally
  correspond to the details of specific files being uploaded, containing no
  data, causing phpMussel to attempt to scan uploaded files when no files
  were actually being uploaded, resulting in an "Unauthorised file manipulation
  detected!" message being returned to the client and the subsequent pageload
  being prevented. To work around this problem, the compatibility directive
  "ignore_upload_errors" has been implemented (by default, deactivated), which
  when activated in configuration should hopefully prevent this issue from
  arising.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=58&t=2786
- Failed condition matching whereby signature file instance should be
  terminated found to not always be triggering correctly. Fixed.

=== Version 0.3e (Previous: 0.3d; Next: 0.3f) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18487+3e).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- I'm working on building a more thorough testing kit for signatures in an
  attempt to resolve, or at least better avoid, the PCRE crashing issue.
  Not included in actual release.. But the effects of it will be.
- Found a way to reduce on duplication: Less signatures overall included in
  this release compared to previous releases, but, overall level of protection
  should be the same, if not better.
- A lot of former *_standard.cvd signatures rewritten as *_regex.cvd
  signatures (such as the lot from PhishTank.com mentioned in the previous
  update) to improve effectiveness and reduce false-positives.
- Expanded on usable conditions slightly.
- I've -began- working on multilingual support for phpMussel. Can set
  appropriate language options via configuration file. Support is minimum at
  this point in time. Will improve as time passes.
- Improved the default Upload Denied message template file slightly.
- Added a new test file.
- Minor code tweaks for improved performance.

=== Version 0.3d (Previous: 0.3c; Next: 0.3e) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18473+3d).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Improved documentation (README file now available in multiple languages:
  English, Indonesian and French; Will expand this to other languages when
  I can find the time; Core program remains entirely in English at this point,
  but I am thinking about adding full multilingual support, eventually. It
  takes a long time, though, and working on the actual programming itself is
  always going to be higher priority, so I'm not putting a deadline on this
  particular idea at all).
- Increased stringency of phpMussel_mail() function (also,
  mail_mussel_standard.cvd signatures will now be incorporating data from a
  number of additional sources, such as that from PhishTank.com).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Optional conditional length matching issue with some signature types found
  and fixed.

=== Version 0.3c (Previous: 0.3b; Next: 0.3d) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18240+3c).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Extended the signature formatting for custom signatures.
- Improved interpretation by phpMussel of ClamAV signatures compared
  to previous version of the script.
- Improved documentation.
- Some conditions can now be inserted into signature files to control
  when certain signatures are and aren't utilised.

Maikuolan,
17th December 2013.

=== Version 0.3b (Previous: 0.3a; Next: 0.3c) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18175+3b).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Added controls (refer to phpmussel.ini) concerning the length of signatures.
  It is now possible to specify a minimum and maximum length requirement for
  the execution of signatures.
- Rewrote the code for handling general commands (should see a very minor speed
  and memory usage improvement).
- Added the option to block control characters.
- Added a new code block into the core script which checks for the existence of
  all variables expected to be parsed from "phpmussel.ini", and if any are
  missing, sets these missing variables with their default values. This should
  ensure that if any user modifies the configuration file incorrectly or with
  incorrect information, or if the configuration file somehow becomes
  corrupted, the chances of php returning missing variable warnings or fatal
  errors are reduced and proper function of the script is better safeguarded.
- Added support for running phpMussel independantly from any hooks under CLI
  mode (command line interface) on Windows. While I'd continue to suggest that
  conventional anti-virus programs are going to be faster and more effective
  than phpMussel, if you do wish to use phpMussel as a file scanner to check
  specific files on a Windows based machine outside of the webserver, it is
  now possible to do so without the need to manually edit the core script or
  reverse-hook phpMussel (refer to "readme.txt" for more details).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- A minor bug in the email scanning function which could potentially prevent
  the function from executing under certain conditions was found and fixed.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FOUND:
- A major bug that exists in the PCRE packages included with the php builds
  used to test phpMussel prior to release has been found to cause phpMussel
  to crash php altogether under certain circumstances. I've worked on some
  basic dirty work-arounds for the problem which should occasionally prevent
  the problem from occurring, but the problem is not altogether resolved.

=== Version 0.3a (Previous: 0.3b; Next: 0.3) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+18088+3a).
Sub-minor release; Previous versions not compatible with the current version of
the updater (high priority).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found there was an incorrectly written condition operand which would cause
  the update script to always register CRC32 hashes as being mismatched,
  even if they were a correct match. Fixed it. Literally is one byte of
  difference, but unfortunately, will be required to manually update to the
  latest version before using the update script, because the old version won't
  work. Tested the update locally and it seems to work fine now.

11th November 2013.

=== Version 0.3 (Previous: 0.2b; Next: 0.3a) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+17971+3).
Minor release; Previous versions not compatible with the current version of
the updater (high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Built a (very basic) command interface and an updater !!
  Implemented a POST, GET and QUERY based command system, whereby certain
  functions can be performed by triggering them via either POST, GET or QUERY,
  meaning.. you can do things to phpMussel from within your browser.
- phpMussel can now be updated automatically via password protected command.
- phpMussel can be enabled and disabled via password protected command.
- Logs can be viewed from your browser via password protected command.
- Refined the main script and heavily expanded on non ClamAV sigantures.
- Added signature greylisting capabilities.
- Added some basic fraudulent metadata detections.

=== Version 0.2b (Previous: 0.2a; Next: 0.3) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest ClamAV signatures (55+17946).
Experimental release (not stable; stable changes rolled to next version).

Maikuolan,
8th October 2013.

=== Version 0.2a (Previous: 0.2; Next: 0.2b) ===
SUMMARY:
Sub-minor release; Previous versions not compatible with the current version of
the updater (high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Did a bit of research; Added a bunch of signatures to the custom signatures.
  These are all signatures that I strongly feel should be included with
  phpMussel, but, because they are neither related to the testfiles nor a part
  of signature set obtained from ClamAV, I've opted to place them in customs.
  Of course, if anyone disagrees, they are more than welcome to remove them.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Fixed a small problem found concerning occasionally mismatched file
  extensions that were causing some strange false-positives in testing (mostly
  concerning zip files and c files).

Maikuolan,
1st October 2013.

=== Version 0.2 (Previous: 0.1a; Next: 0.2a) ===
SUMMARY:
My many thanks to those that helped with testing out the initial (and
subsequent) release of phpMussel. :-)
After receiving some great suggestions and ideas from Tobias (Spambotsecurity)
regarding the previous release of phpMussel, I went to work changing a lot
of what had been coded into the previous releases, combining most of those
suggestions with a couple of new tricks I'd learned over the course of the
past few days. These changes overall should drastically improve the
performance, speed and effectiveness of phpMussel, as well as correct some
theoretical exploits discovered. I've also began working on implementing
more of the ClamAV signatures than the previous version could support, and
while this version is by no means complete, it should be a drastic improvement
over the previous version. It should be noted that modifications have been
made to the vault files and signature files against, thus, this version of the
script will not be compatible with previous versions of the script.

NEW CHANGES:
- Added support for GZIP'd files (can now read and interpret the contents
  of GZIP'd files, parse GZIP metadata, and, can do so recursively; new
  configuration option added to control maximum recursion depth)! With that,
  phpMussel now supports GZ and ZIP encoded archives. Though, ZIPs still
  aren't recursive and other common formats (7z, RAR) aren't yet supported.
- Removed several custom-built functions altogether, replacing with faster
  php-native equivalents, with new custom-built functions implemented to mimic
  these functions when not available for purposes of backwards-compatibility.
- Improved compatibility with external error handlers.
- Multi-instance checking implemented.
- Generally improved coding to reduce risk of warning flags (New/Fixed?).
- Extended signatures have been (mostly) implemented (although, split into
  segments for improved performance and usability). At this point, even
  after a bit of research, I've still got absolutely no idea how to correctly
  implement PE Sectional signatures, so, I suspect that one may take a long
  time to get done. However, otherwise, most signatures should now be
  implemented correctly. Normalised signatures (HTML, ASCII, etc) coming soon.
  At this point, MD5, archive metadata, mail, Macho-O, graphics, PE
  (non-Sectional), ELF and general signatures are supported.
- Regex now supported.
- Signature mapping incorporate, to reduce load-time of signatures.
- Began implementation of proper block notifications. Intend to expand this
  at a later date.
- New testfile set (replacing old testfile set).
- Added an email scanning function (will need to implement this yourself as
  per your specific requirements).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- While the time requirements for checking against ClamAV signatures still
  leaves something to be desired, the time requirements have been more than
  halved in most testing instances. Although not ideal, I think this has
  been improved enough to warrant making note of it here.
- phpMussel now supports wildcards (thus increasing the number of ClamAV
  signatures that can be correctly checked against)!
- Several bugs found since the previous release fixed prior to this one (can
  directly compare code between versions if necessary; mostly sub-minor bugs).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FOUND:
- As a side-effect of changes to this version, although time requirements
  for signatures has been generally reduced, this reduction is scaled by both
  the quantity and size of the files being scanned. Additionally, the memory
  requirements of the script per each file being scanned, at present, is about
  ~2.7xFilesize (example: if we assumed approximately ~2MB was required for the
  script itself, assumed that all loaded signatures for that instance required
  about ~6.7MB and assumed that the file targeted for scanning had a filesize
  of about ~24.4MB, the total memory required by the process would be somewhere
  in the range of ~74.6MBs). On php5, where the default memory limit is set
  at 128MBs, this isn't a problem. However, for php4, where the default memory
  limit is 64MBs, or for older versions of php where the default memory limit
  is even less, this would cause maximum memory exceeded fatal warning to be
  supplied by php and cause the entire script (including whatever is hooking
  the script) to die prematurely. For the time being, a solution for older
  systems is to simply set a lower filesize threshold in the phpMussel
  configuration file. However, in the long term, another, better, solution
  should be found.
