# phpMussel
PHP-based anti-virus anti-trojan anti-malware solution.

I plan to hopefully fork my project here to this repository at some point in the not too distant future, though I haven't yet had the chance to do so. For the time being, until I do so, my project data can be accessed via <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmussel/>. Related discussion for my forking over to GitHub can be located via <http://www.spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=3446>.

Thank you.

Kind Regards,
Caleb M / Maikuolan.
